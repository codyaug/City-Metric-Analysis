# City-Metric-Analysis
This code analyzes and visualizes the relationship between various economic factors and the rent to price ratio in different cities. The data is loaded from three separate CSV files, which contain information on median rent, population, average wage, and number of jobs in different cities. The data is then merged, cleaned, and processed to calculate various growth rates, including the economic growth rate, job growth rate, and population growth rate. Finally, the processed data is grouped by region and normalized to control for population size. Finally, the code creates scatter plots to visualize the relationship between the rent to price ratio and each of the growth rates. These plots allow us to explore the relationship between different economic factors and the cost of living in different cities.
